                Web developers need a combination of graphic design skills and technical computer skills that will allow them to create particular designs on web pages. In addition to looking nice, websites need to be functional and secure. It is the responsibility of web developers to create such sites that meet the requirements of employers or clients.

             <p>
                Web developers work closely with project managers and designers to ensure that final products adhere to predetermined budgets, scope, and designs. Web developers sometimes need to be able to show employers or clients a prototype of a website to help them understand what the finished product will be.
